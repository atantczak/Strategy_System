I've built a trading strategy analysis system on my local machine over the past few months and I've now transferred a generalized version of it to GitHub. IE ~ I have a system that takes input data and trading signals and runs them through a simulation. However, I've built my system to test out, say, a MACD signal used for buying and selling. Obviously there are plenty of other trading signals you could use. Therefore, I've generalized the system to an extent and included an example signal such that those who are interested can adopt and adapt it to their liking.

The framework for this system is laid out below in this work flow image.
